https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories

##Prefix
The list of Open Source projects below was assembled to provide HPE employees an opportunity to focus their open source contribution in a manner that might benefit both the employee and HPE. As these projects are some of the busiest projects on GitHub, they provide a great opportunity for employees to work on meaningful and disruptive innovations while building a name for themselves.

These projects where picked and represent a broad spectrum of domains.


##Containers
###Docker

**Domain:** Containerization

**Stars:** 27,662

**Language:** Go

**Link:** https://github.com/docker/docker

**What:** Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container. Docker leads the container disruption which is a strategic pillar for HPE in the new data center. Containers also enable the introduction of micro-services architecture which impacts development stacks. Docker is built from a set of projects that make up the Docker set of engines.

**Why:** Docker is causing a ripple effect in both dev and ops so worth to keep a close eye on what’s happening.

###runc
**Domain:** Containerization

**Stars:** 2409

**Language:** Go

**Link:** https://github.com/opencontainers/runc

**What:** runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCF specification.

**Why:** runc is a slim down version of the core Docker engine that was contributed to the Open Container initiative, hence will become the de-facto standard of how to run Open Container Format (OCI) compliant containers. We’ll be able to influence the runtime standard.

###cAdvisor
**Domain:** Monitoring

**Stars:** 3,337

**Language:** Go

**Link:** https://github.com/google/cadvisor

**What:** cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers. It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers. Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics. This data is exported by container and machine-wide.

**Why:** cAdvisor is widely used in container development phase within DevOps pipelines as well as basic production environments. We’ll be able to influence not only container monitoring but also DevOps pipeline.

###Kubernetes
**Domain:** Containerization

**Stars:** 12,061

**Language:** Go

**Link:** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes

**What:** Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

###Apache Mesos
**Domain:** Data Center

**Stars:** 1969

**Language:** C++

**Link:** https://github.com/apache/mesos

**What:** Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop, MPI, Hypertable, Spark, and other frameworks on a dynamically shared pool of nodes.

**Why:** As data center become a set of programmable resource pools, solutions like Mesos allows IT to manage it at scale and deliver a true programmable data center to its internal customers.

###Ansible
**Domain:** Data Center

**Stars:** 14,845

**Language:** Python

**Link:** https://github.com/ansible/ansible

**What:** Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications— automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. http://ansible.com/

**Why:** TBD


##Big Data
###Apache Spark
**Domain:** Big Data

**Stars:** 6960

**Language:** Scala

**Link:** https://github.com/apache/spark

**What:** Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

**Why:** In big data and advanced analytics, Spark is a de-facto standard of how to run advanced analytics at scale. Some call it the future of Hadoop.

###neo4J
**Domain:** Big Data

**Stars:** 2328

**Language:** Java

**Link:** https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j

**What:** Neo4j is the world’s leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables — yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.

**Why:** In the world of big data and advanced analytics, graph databases are a cornerstone element capable of solving a wide spectrum of issues. HPE’s The Machine advanced analytics stack will be based on graph analytics.


##Development
###Swift
**Domain:** Development

**Stars:** 25,532

**Language:** C++

**Link:** https://github.com/apple/swift

**What:** Swift is a high-performance system programming language. It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe (by default).

**Why:** Switft is Apple’s open source development language that is trending high with developers and looks like to become one of the leading development languages, alongside Go and Python. It is in early stages, so we could still influence its direction.
